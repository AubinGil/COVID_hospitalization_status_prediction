# COVID_hospitalization_status_prediction
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on healthcare systems worldwide, necessitating efficient patient triage to optimize resource allocation. This project aims to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict the hospitalization status of COVID-19 positive patients based on their demographic and clinical characteristics.The dataset is composed After testing three different algoritms (Decision tree, Random forest and Gradient Boosted Regression Tree(GBRT)) we decided to use GBRT due its higher predictive power. We used Precision, accuracy and F1 recall score to determine which algoritm had the best performance during validation. Despite weak correlations among most features, the variable ‘Abnormal chest X-ray’ shows a moderate correlation with hospitalization status, indicating its potential predictive value. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in emergency room settings by accurately identifying high-risk patients, thereby improving patient outcomes, reducing wait times, and optimizing the management of healthcare resources during periods of high disease transmission.
